# Network Traffic Prediction
Introduction
In the modern era, mobile phones are not just a luxury but a basic necessity. As cellular traffic demand soars, it becomes imperative to predict user traffic within cellular networks accurately. This prediction helps in optimizing resource allocation and utilization, ensuring a seamless experience for the user. This project leverages Machine Learning (ML) techniques, specifically the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model, to analyze and predict cellular traffic.

Objectives
Using the power of Machine Learning and its applicability in 5G cellular networks, we target the following main objectives:

Prediction of Packet Arrival Intensity: Estimate the volume of packets that will arrive in a given time interval.

Analysis of Inter-packet Arrival: Examine the time interval between incoming and outgoing packets.

Data Clustering: Categorize the cellular data into four distinct applications: surfing, video calling, voice calling, and video streaming.

Prediction of Burst Occurrence: Forecast the probability of a sudden surge or burst in traffic within a specified future time frame.
